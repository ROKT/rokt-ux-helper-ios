## Requirements

- Download the latest [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Project is configured to run on iOS 15.0 and above and compiled with the latest version of iOS.
- clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:ROKT/rokt-ux-helper-ios.git`

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

#### Xcode

To integrate to your Xcode project, select File > Add Package Dependency and enter
`https://github.com/ROKT/rokt-ux-helper-ios`.
You can also navigate to your target's General pane, and in the "Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content" section, click the + button, select Add Other, and choose Add Package Dependency.

#### Swift package

To integrate to your Swift package, add the following SPM dependency into your `Package.swift` file. This configuration ensures that your app will receive updates to the library up to, but not including, the next major release.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ROKT/rokt-ux-helper-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    RoktUX[RoktUX] --> |Initiates and manages| LayoutTransformer
    RoktUX --> |Creates and manages| LayoutState


    %% Layout transformation
    LayoutTransformer --> |Transforms to| LayoutSchemaViewModel
    LayoutTransformer --> |Uses| CreativeMapper[CreativeSyntaxMapper]
    CreativeMapper --> |Processes BNF placeholders| LayoutSchemaViewModel
    LayoutSchemaViewModel --> |Renders as| UIComponents

    %% Configuration and state
    RoktUXConfig[RoktUXConfig] --> |Configures| RoktUX
    LayoutState --> |Manages state for| UIComponents
```

The RoktUX Helper iOS follows a unidirectional data flow architecture with these key components:

- **RoktUX**: The main entry point that orchestrates the rendering process and manages the overall state
- **LayoutTransformer**: Converts layout schema from backend responses into view models
- **CreativeSyntaxMapper**: Processes BNF (Backus-Naur Form) placeholders in layout content, transforming them into the final display values
- **LayoutSchemaViewModel**: Represents the UI structure in a framework-agnostic way
- **LayoutState**: Maintains the state of UI components and handles user interactions
- **UIComponents**: The actual UI components rendered on screen (compatible with both SwiftUI and UIKit)

Data flows from the backend response through the transformer and creative mapper to create view models with resolved placeholders, which are then rendered as UI components. User interactions flow back through the state management system to trigger callbacks and state updates.

## Opening the Project

Open the `Package.swift` file with Xcode to start development.

### How to run unit tests locally?

Press `command + U`, or `Product -> Test` from the menu bar.

## Key Dependencies & Gotchas

### SDK Dependencies

- **DcuiSchema**: Core library for parsing experience response. Any schema changes require careful testing to ensure compatibility.
- **ViewInspector**: Used only for testing - not included in production builds.

### Integration Gotchas

1. **iOS Version Compatibility**: The library requires iOS 15.0+. Using with earlier iOS versions will not render any layouts.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Schema parsing errors are handled gracefully but may result in empty views

### How to Update the Layouts Schema File

1. Ensure the Swift version of SSOT has been released in [DCUI-Schema-Repo](https://github.com/ROKT/dcui-layout-schema)
2. Update dcui-swift-schema dependency version in package.swift to the latest version
   `.package(url: "https://github.com/ROKT/dcui-swift-schema.git", exact: "x.y.z"),`
3. Verify `schema.swift` is updated

## Example App

An example app is available in this repository to demonstrate integration with RoktUXHelper using both SwiftUI and UIKit. For detailed implementation examples, refer to the [example app README](https://github.com/ROKT/rokt-ux-helper-ios/tree/main/Example).

## FAQ

### 1. Documentation

For detailed documentation, check the [SwiftUI integration guide](https://docs.rokt.com/server-to-server/ios?platform=swiftui) and [UIKit integration guide](https://docs.rokt.com/server-to-server/ios?platform=uikit).

### 2. What are the branches?

There are main branches coresponding to each version : **Main**, **Release branches** and **Features branches**

- **main** - This is the main, default branch. Feature branches merge back into this branch, and release branches are created off this branch.
- **release branches** - This branch is production ready.
- **feature branches** - After every push to this branch swift lint and tests are run to ensure no breaking changes are allowed.

## Creating a Release

To create a new release version:

1. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "Create draft release from main" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" and use the dropdown to bump the version
4. Click "Run workflow" to start the process

This workflow will:

- Create a release PR with the specified version allowing you to review
- Generate release notes based on CHANGELOG.md

### Note

The version number should only be updated from that workflow, so decline any PR with changes to the VERSION file.
