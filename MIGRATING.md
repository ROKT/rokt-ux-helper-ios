# Migration guide

This document provides guidance on migrating to newer versions of `rokt-ux-helper-ios`.

## Migrating from versions < 0.3.0

From version **0.3.0 onwards**, the `ImageLoader` class has been **renamed** to `RoktUXImageLoader` to maintain consistency with the library's naming conventions.
